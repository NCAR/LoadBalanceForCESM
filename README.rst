b2deg_alternative.py
Contains majority of the code related to building and running CESM models. The configuration for the built models happens within this python file. Depends on inputs from the cesm_allocation.py.

--prototype_run()
Original function that was devised based off of the bash implementation that was supplied by Brian Dobbins. The function takes two command line arguments that. Has no bearing on the current implementation of the code. Kept for preserving the original structure of code.

--processorMultiplierFunc(numOfProcessors, processorMultiplier,permissionToScale)
This function will scale the processors of the CESM models while building. There can be linear scaling by 2 or exponential scaling by 2. The information for scaling is stored within the dictionary for the CESM values.For functionality related to scaling, focus on this function in particular. Only call this function in the possiility that a CESM parameter will be scaled. Exponential scaling allows for scaling with the indicated powers and linear scaling allows for scaling with the indicated multiples.

cesm_allocation.py
The load balncing software code is initiated in this file and the function that manages the highest level function amongst b2deg_alternative.py and cesm_allocation.py. This python file is the one that is run from the command line.

Setup:
Make the following challenges to optimize.py
Add this function:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""The dict_optimized_values is a function to extract a dictionary of the CESM values that will be used by the next CESM model builds and runs."""
def dict_optimized_values(ntasksDictTarget, rootpeDictTarget, nthreadsDictTarget, totaltasksValue):# Place in optimize.py to return ntasks dictionary
    import os#Imports os
    import json#Imports json
    logger.info("Beginning to write the json")#Starts to write the json file
    json_location_prefix = "optimization_dictionaries"#Will be the prefix for the name of the job
    placeholderDictionary = {}#Dictionary to be used for storing the CESM parameters.
    placeholderDictionary.update({"ntasks": ntasksDictTarget})#The placeholherDictionary is being updated witht he "ntasks" dictionary
    placeholderDictionary.update({"rootpe": rootpeDictTarget})#The placeholherDictionary is being updated witht he "rootpe" dictionary
    placeholderDictionary.update({"nthrds": nthreadsDictTarget})#The placeholherDictionary is being updated witht he "nthrds" dictionary
    placeholderDictionary.update({"totaltasks": totaltasksValue})#The placeholherDictionary is being updated witht he "totaltasks" dictionary
    json_location_exist = True#Boolean to chck that the file name eists
    iteration = 1#Increments to provide a number to differentiate the json files from one another
    logger.info("Checking json file presence.")#Start of the process to check for presence of file with proposed file name.
    while json_location_exist == True:#True to ensure that there the process is being checked.
        json_location_prefix_iteration_combo = json_location_prefix+str(iteration)#Puts together the file name with the number appended.
        if os.path.isfile("/glade/work/"+os.environ["USER"]+"/optimum_json/"+json_location_prefix_iteration_combo+".json"):#Checks to make sure the proposed file name is not already in usage in the specified directory.
            logger.info("Must edit file name.")#If the file name is already in use, edits must be name to the proposed file name
            iteration += 1#Increment the iteration up by 1.
        else:
            logger.info("New json file name is available.")#The JSON file name can be utilized.
            json_location_prefix = json_location_prefix_iteration_combo#Assign the proposed JSON file name to the json_location_prefix variable
            json_location_exist= False#Boolean json_location_exist variable is assigned the value of False
    with open("/glade/work/"+os.environ["USER"]+"/optimum_json/"+json_location_prefix+".json", "w") as amendableFile:#Opening up the new json file to be written to.
        json.dump(placeholderDictionary, amendableFile)#Writes to the opened jsonfile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add call for said function in the write_pe_template() function of optimize_model.py for Load Balancing Code.

Basic Execution Instructions:
In the command line, type cesm_allocation.py [max_tasks_to_be_allocated].
Then proceed to type in the user responses to the inputs that are prompted.
Wait for CESM models to build and successfully run then confirm whether load balancing software should be initiated.
